I really believe we could benefit by focusing both on discrepancies in attitudes (e.g. most people who dislike transgenic crops don't mind mutagenic ones) and by communicating about how iGEM is open house and takes social and environmental impacts very seriously.,,,,,,I sometimes host okay potlucks,,,,
