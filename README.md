A script written for the 2015 [Waterloo iGEM](http://igem.uwaterloo.ca) team when going through new applicants. The script accepts applications in CSV format, with each row corresponding to one applicant. Details on input arguments provided in the script header.

[Various][1] [studies][2] [of job applications][3] have shown that obscuring applicant names increases the gender and racial diversity of the applicants accepted for interviews. This alone is a strong argument for anonymization, but it was also helpful for our team because it removed conflicts of interest caused by knowing some of the applicants personally. 

I hope this (very hacky) script is useful either to future iGEM teams or to others looking to anonymize job applications.
